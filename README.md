Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It belongs to the ensemble learning methods, which means it combines multiple individual models to produce a more powerful predictive model. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees during training and merges their predictions to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the model.
